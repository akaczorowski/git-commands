You can delete a merged local branch with:

git branch -d branchname
If it's not merged, use:

git branch -D branchname
To delete it from the remote in old versions of Git use:

git push origin :branchname
In more recent versions of Git use:

git push --delete origin branchname
Once you delete the branch from the remote, you can prune to get rid of remote tracking branches with:

git remote prune origin
or prune individual remote tracking branches, as the other answer suggests, with:

git branch -dr branchname
